			KTAP License

ktap is released as GPL license.

ktap is based on lua programming language initially,
so I need to give credits to lua.

lua licensed as MIT, lua stats: (in http://www.lua.org/license.html)

    The spirit of the Lua license is that you are free to use Lua
    for any purpose at no cost without having to ask us. The only
    requirement is that if you do use Lua, then you should give us
    credit by including the copyright notice somewhere in your product
    or its documentation.

So that's why there have a lua_copyright_notice.txt in doc/.

But note tha ktap software definitely released as GPL license, this is not
violation aganist to MIT license, since MIT license is simple and liberal
and is compatible with GPL.
(This license solution was agreed with lua team)


(From software design point of view, there could be remove this MIT copyright
notice completely, because ktap possibly will use a new design compiler and
interpreter in future, note this is just for software design reason, and have
nothing to do with license, even though, I will still give credit to lua)
