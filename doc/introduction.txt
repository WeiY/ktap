Introduction
------------

A New Scripting Dynamic Tracing Tool For Linux

KTAP is a new scripting dynamic tracing tool for Linux,
it uses a scripting language and lets users trace the Linux kernel dynamically.
KTAP is designed to give operational insights with interoperability
that allow users to tune, troubleshoot and extend kernel and application.
It's similar with Linux Systemtap and Solaris Dtrace.

KTAP have different design principles from Linux mainstream dynamic tracing
language in that it's based on bytecode, so it doesn't depend upon GCC,
doesn't require compiling a kernel module, safe to use in production
environment, fulfilling the embedd ecosystem's tracing needs.

KTAP also is designed for enabling great interoperability with Linux kernel,
it gives user the power to modify and extend the system, and let users
explore the system in an easy way.

KTAP implementation is initial based on Lua programming language,
Lua is a powerful, fast, lightweight, embeddable scripting language.
KTAP changed a lot on Lua, for better suit for kernel embedding purpose.
Thanks Lua.

Requirements
------------
- Linux 3.1 or later(Need some kernel patches for kernel earlier than 3.1)
- CONFIG_RELAY enabled
- CONFIG_EVENT_TRACING enabled
- CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS enabled
- CONFIG_KPROBES enabled 
- CONFIG_KALLSYMS enabled
- CONFIG_DEBUG_FS enabled
  (make sure debugfs mounted before insmod ktapvm
   mount debugfs: mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug/)

Note that those configruation is always enabled in Linux distribution,
like REHL, Fedora, Unbuntu, etc.


Building & Running
------------------

1) Clone ktap  

	[root@jovi]# git clone https://github.com/ktap/ktap.git

2) Compiling ktap  

	[root@jovi]# cd ktap
	[root@jovi]# make       #generate ktapvm kernel module
	[root@jovi]# make ktap  #generate userspace ktap tool

3) Insert ktapvm kernel module(make sure debugfs mounted)  

	[root@jovi]# insmod ./ktapvm.ko

4) Running ktap  

	[root@jovi]# ./ktap scripts/syscalls.kp
